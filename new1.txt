1. Multiplexing: Multiple Requests at same time

HTTP/1.1 It deals with one request at a time, which can make loading websites slower.

HTTP/2: HTTP/2 introduced multiplexing, which allows multiple requests and responses to happen simultaneously. This speeds things up!

2. Header Compression:

HTTP/1.1: Every time you make a request, it comes with headers. But in HTTP/1.1, these headers can be large and repetitive.

HTTP/2: HTTP/2 is smarter. It compresses these headers, making them smaller and more efficient, which in turn makes websites load faster.

3. Server Push: 

HTTP/1.1: You ask for one thing, and you get that one thing.

HTTP/2: The server can guess what else you might need and send it to you even before you ask. For instance, if you ask for a webpage, the server might also send the images or stylesheets because it knows you'll probably ask for them next.

4. Connection: 

HTTP/1.1: Every time you make a request, a new connection is created

HTTP/2: fewer delays and faster loading times.

5. Binary vs Textual:

HTTP/1.1: Uses textual protocol, which means it communicates in text. This is easier for humans to read but not always the best for machines.

HTTP/2: It's binary. While it might be gibberish for most of us, machines love it! They can read and process binary data faster than text.

HTTP/2 was created to make our online experiences faster, smoother, and more efficient. While many websites have migrated to HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1 isn't going away anytime soon. It's essential to understand the key differences, especially if you're in the web development world. It's all about delivering information quickly and efficiently, and HTTP/2 has taken significant strides in that direction!
